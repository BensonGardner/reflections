When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you know you will be using more than one computer, or when you want to ensure you don't lose your
work if something happens to your computer (i.e., you want to keep a backup), 
or when you are collaborating, or when you want your work to be public even while it's in progress. 
You also might create a remote repository at the end to share your work, even if none of these
other factors applied during the process of coding.
