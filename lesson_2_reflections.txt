Initializing a repository creates a hidden
.git folder but it appears only to track files that
are added from that point forward. If there is a
pre-existing file, you will have to use git add to
start tracking it with git.

Not true! Actually even creating a few file doesn't result in tracking.

"How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?"

it doesn't contain everything in your working direcotyr -- only the files you have added (and
possibly also the files you have changed). WAit, I think you don't need to have changed them. It sounds like the files in the working directoyr that have been added might be automatically changed in the staging area.

The staging area is only saved in the repository when you make a commit (save a file).

Since your commits will save multiple files, maybe the staging area cuts down on processing time becuase it's constantly changing to try to match your file status.

"How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?"

You can add your file to the staging area as you make changes, making sure in this way not to lose anything you might need to go back to. (at least, you can do this once) But you can thereby refrain from actually committing anythiing until you've finished with that particular logical change. so it give you a place to temporarily store stuff without committing to it (get it?).
